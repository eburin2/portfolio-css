# _Portfolio-CSS(sass project)_

#### By _Elliot Burin_

## Process Description

_Right off the bat I found a template that looked pretty simple and clean to replicate and add on to.  My ultimate goal was to make this site look clean as possible. I felt that it was important to include a little about myself, share some interests i have, and most importantly link some of my work from the last few weeks.  The whole day was spent pretty much experimenting, seeing if certain elements made the page look too busy or not.  Overall I executed what I wanted to in the 9 hour period.  Although, my breakpoint could have used some extra work on margins and font-sizes._
